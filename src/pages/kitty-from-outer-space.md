This is good new home for all the random scattered posts and thoughts I have
spread across many different blogs, meetups, conferences and other events.

In future we will collect all these in this nice place and make sure our kitty
from outer space looks after all of them. One day I may write where the name
came from, for now just love the logo and smile about the name.
