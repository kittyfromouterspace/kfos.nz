        KFOS invested over the years in early stage startups and has a pool of
        companies we are working with at various stages. Our investment
        strategy is always long-term and we are not interested in quick wins
        through hyped trends but rather invest in long-term gains for all sides
        involved. Our view is never just financial but also on the bigger
        impact the company has on the region, employees and other social
        aspects.  </p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">
        <a href="https://iwantmyname.com">iwantmyname</a> is one of the larger
        investments we did over the years and is today a globally trading
        domain name registrar. We have managed to establish iwantmyname in a
        very crowed market and it has been growing nicely since 2008. The
        interesting bits we are especially prowd of in iwantmyname is the
        pioneering work we did on the cultural aspects of a remote working team
        and the technical foundation we created that was way ahead of its time.

        <a href="https://makemy.sale">makemy.sale</a> is one of our newer
        investments and still pre-revenue. We work towards addressing one of
        the aspects of the housing crisis in New Zealand by providing better
        data to sellers and re-investing some of our proceeds into housing
        projects in New Zealand.  </p>

        KFOS is - to a limited degree - available for consulting gigs. We
        normally only work on our own investments but some causes are too
        important not to help out with. Try to hunt us down if you feel like
        your project can benefit from us helping you. There is no contact form
        on this page so if finding a way to catch us is too hard your cause may
        not be pressing enough :) </p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">
        Investing into community is normally something we do as part of our
        outreach work but every so often we help a region or a team to get
        something across the line that goes beyond our time budget. In these
        cases we do help with consulting hours but if you need help with
        community work, we most likely just help you. Same as above, try to
        find us online :) </p>

        KFOS are Manuela Vetters and Lenz Gschwendtner, if you have worked with
        us you know that we can make a big difference for your project and know
        that only two people are often all that is needed to help you get over
        the next hump.  </p>

        We live part in our Landrover touring the world, part in the Nelson,
        New Zealand region. We have adopted a location independent lifestyle
        but for all legal and financial reasons we are NZ based and KFOS is a
        New Zealand based entity.  </p>
